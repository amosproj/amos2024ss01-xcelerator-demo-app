# Amos Project: Siemens Xcelerator

## Siemens Xcelerator Demo Application

### Goal
This project showcases the Siemens Xcelerator, illustrating Siemens' comprehensive digital execution platform that spans various industries.
This demo application demonstrates the capabilities of Siemens Xcelerator, by simulating a management platform for a water treatment facility.

The user is able to monitor individual pumps, which are located in different facilities. This not only includes the display of the metrics for each pump,
but the ability to create cases. These cases are maintenance orders for, e.g. technicians, to maintain or inspect faulty devices. 

### Developer Platform
Siemens provides extensive developer tools to help organizations create impactful solutions. 
More details are available at [Siemens Xcelerator](https://www.siemens.com/de/de/unternehmen/digitale-transformation/xcelerator.html)

### Outcome
**Developers:** Gain access to Siemens' easy-to-use tools through Xcelerator, simplifying solution development.
**Companies:** Understand how Siemens Xcelerator aids in solving today's complex challenges.

### Amos
AMOS = Agile Methods and Open Source
Students learn Scrum by developing an open source software as a team project over the course of a semester, for an industry partner.
The team consist of students from the FAU, TU Berlin and FU Berlin.
